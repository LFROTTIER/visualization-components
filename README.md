# visualization-components
A set of D3.js-based visualization components

## Getting started

- Go to the folder of the component you want to start with (for instance, ``cd component/bubbletree``).
- Launch a web server, for instance if you have Python 3 installed: ``python -m http.server``.
- Browse to ``http://localhost:8000``.
- See in the ``index.html`` file how the component is integrated in the page and use it the same way in your projects.
