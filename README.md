# visualization-components
This project contains a set of D3.js-based visualization components for data science. These components are designed to be easily reusable in any web project. They are developped in TypeScript, but users do not need the TypeScript source to integrate the component in their projets.

## Getting started

- Go to the folder of the component you want to start with (for instance, ``cd component/bubbletree``).
- Launch a web server, for instance if you have Python 3 installed: ``python -m http.server``.
- Browse to ``http://localhost:8000``.
- See in the ``index.html`` file how the component is integrated in the page and use it the same way in your projects.
